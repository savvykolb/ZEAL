# ZEAL

An application created by a teacher with the goal to help grow students’ leadership, delegation, and organizational skills while easing the stress of group projects. What better way to grow a student’s initiative than by mixing a cool new app that increases the opportunity for working with friends!

### Assign Tasks 
#

Once a project is created, users can now delegate tasks to team members on the project. They can also designate whether the task is high priority, medium priority, or low priority.

### Future Developments 
#

Currently, the development team is working on completing the 'update' portion of our CRUD method. We are also working on fixing our back end bugs, as well as any front end bugs that are persisting. In the future, we would like to add additional features to our application to allow it to be more interactive and have multiple user levels.
